# Ford GoBike Data Analysis
## by Jozo Frankovic


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Beginning operation in August 29th 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share, the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area.

> Key wrangling steps include
>> Making get requests to get data, unzipped it, and combined CSVs together to form one CSV
>> Visually inspected dataset and noted quality issues for cleaning
>> Followed define, code, test iteration to close out all issues and clean data
>> Exported new clean dataset as CSV


## Summary of Findings

> I made a number of findings and visualisations during the exploration phase, including:

>> Univariate

>>> Total number of bike share rides by month
>>> Total number of bike share rides by weekday
>>> Total number of bike share rides by hour
>>> Distribution of duration in minutes

>> Bivariate

>>> Breakdown of user type
>>> Duration of distribution by user type
>>> Total number of bike share rides by month, by user type
>>> Total number of bike share rides by weekday, by user type
>>> Total number of bike share rides by hour, by user type
>>> Total number of bike share rides by month, over the years (to build on previous data view)
>>> Total number of bike share rides by month, by user type (to build on previous data view)

>> Multivariate

>>> Heatmap of bike share rides by day and hour for customers
>>> Heatmap of bike share rides by day and hour for subscribers


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I distilled my exploratory analysis into a number of key themes / threads for the explanatory analysis / presentation:

>> The overwhelming user group appears to be subscribers (representing 78.7% of the total user group)
>> The duration distribution for subscribers is far narrower than that of customers 
>> A weekend effect exists for subscribers, whereby the usage of the service drops off on Saturday and Sunday in comparison to the weekdays. The extent of drop off for customers is lower.
>> Overall, the ride share service has experienced strong growth, with particularly big numbers at the start of 2020. This dropped significantly in March 2020, coinciding with the advent of COVID-19 restrictions.
